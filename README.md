# Phishing Websites Detection - Machine Learning / Deep Learning Science Project

## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)
  
The "Detecting Phishing Websites using Artificial Neural Network" project aims to build a robust machine learning model to identify phishing websites using an artificial neural network. Phishing websites are a significant threat to online security, and this project focuses on developing an effective solution to protect users from falling victim to such attacks. The neural network architecture, compared with some machine learning models such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, SVM; dataset and model evaluation results are presented in this repository.

The dataset employed in this project is provided by Kaggle at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eswarchandt/phishing-website-detector
